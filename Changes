Revision history for Perl extension Algorithm::SpatialIndex

0.06   Wed Jun  1 00:33:00 CEST 2011
  - Extended the API for buckets.
  - Made bucket implementation pluggable for optional, more efficient
    implementations.
  - Delegate filtering for rectangles to the bucket implementation
    if possible.

0.05   Sat Feb 26 14:15:00 CEST 2011
  - Introduced a default maximum depth of the trees of 20 levels.
    This takes precedence over limited bucket size and thus fixes
    an issue with too many items being very close to one another
    continuously overflowing buckets. [Marten Cieluch]

0.04   Sun Jan 23 14:00:00 CEST 2011
  - Refactoring of the Strategy interface and public interface to
    allow for 3D indexes.
  - Introduction of the Algorithm::SpatialIndex::Strategy::2D
    and Algorithm::SpatialIndex::Strategy::3D base classes for
    2D/3D indexes.
  - Introduction of the first implementation of an oct tree
    as Algorithm::SpatialIndex::Strategy::OctTree.

0.03   Sat Jan 22 20:00:00 CEST 2011
  - Quad tree with six coordinates instead of four.
  - Updated example benchmark.
  - Fix for the storage and strategy plugin detection.
  - Refactoring for Algorithm::SpatialIndex::Strategy::MedianQuadTree
    compatibility.

0.02   Wed Jan 10 20:00:00 CEST 2011
  - First release with experimental DBI backend.

0.01   Sat Jan  8 20:00:00 CEST 2011
