=head1 NAME

Algorithm::SpatialIndex::Strategy - Base class for indexing strategies

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Algorithm::SpatialIndex;
  my $idx = Algorithm::SpatialIndex->new(
    strategy => 'QuadTree', # or others
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the base class for all algorithm implementations (I<Strategies>)
in C<Algorithm::SpatialIndex>. Your implementation should probably not
inherit from this class directly, but from either L<Algorithm::SpatialIndex::Strategy::2D>
or L<Algorithm::SpatialIndex::Strategy::3D> depending on the dimensionality of
your index.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 insert

Inserts a new element into the index. Arguments:
Element (not node!) integer id, Element x/y (and possibly z) coordinates.

Needs to be implemented in a subclass.

=head2 find_node_for

Given x/y (or x/y/z) coordinates, returns
the L<Algorithm::SpatialIndex::Node>
that contains the given point.

Returns undef if the point is outside of the index range.

Needs to be implemented in a subclass.

=head2 find_nodes_for

Given two sets of x/y (or x/y/z) coordinates, returns
all L<Algorithm::SpatialIndex::Node>s that are completely
or partly within the rectangle defined by the two points.

Needs to be implemented in a subclass.

=head2 new

Constructor. Called by the L<Algorithm::SpatialIndex>
constructor. You probably do not need to call or implement this.
Calls your C<init> method if available.

=head2 init

If your subcass implements this, it will be called on the
fresh object in the constructor.

=head2 init_storage

If your subcass implements this, it will be called on the
in the constructor after initializing its storage attribute.

=head2 no_of_dimensions

A method returning the number of dimensions that the index handles.

This is set to a default in the 2D/3D subclasses.

=head2 no_of_subnodes

Returns the number of subnodes per node. Required by the storage
initialization.

This is set to a default in the 2D/3D subclasses.

=head2 coord_types

Returns (as a list) all node coordinate's types. If you need to store
one x/y pair of floating point coordinates per node, you may return:

  qw(double double)

or if less precision is acceptable for space savings:

  qw(float float)

If you need to store three coordinates but only in one dimension,
you simply do:

  qw(float float float)

The storage backend is free to upgrade a float to a double
value and even an integer to a double.

Valid coordinate types are:

  float, double, integer, unsigned

The integer types will be treated as C longs (likely 32bit).

This is set to a default in the 2D/3D subclasses.
You may want to override that in your subclass.

=head2 item_coord_types

Same as coord_types, but indicating what's required for each
item stored in the tree.

This is set to a default in the 2D/3D subclasses.
